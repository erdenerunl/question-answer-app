This project is a question-answer application named as Demande.com. New questions can be asked within the application, questions can be listed on the home page. When asking questions, the category is determined. Thus, the questions on the main page are listed by category. "Component-based design" was applied as much as possible in the project. Switching between pages was done with the help of "vue-router". "Vuex" and "props methods" are used for state management. "Json-server" was used for the data base part and http-requests are made with "axios". The times of the added questions were recorded and printed on the screen with "moment.js".
